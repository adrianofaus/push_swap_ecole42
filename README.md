## Introduction
The Push swap project is an algorithm project where data must be sorted. There is a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. The goal was write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the STDOUT the smallest program, made of push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## Skills that I have improved
* Sorting algorithms
* Battery concept and handling elements
* Algorithm implementation
